# Comments

YASL supports both inline comments and block comments.

Inline comments start with `#` and go until the end of the line. 

Block comments start with `/*` and go until the closing `*/`. 
They cannot be nested.

```
# This is an inline comment.

/*
 This is a block comment.
 It spans multiple lines.
 */
```
